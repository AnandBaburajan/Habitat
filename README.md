# Habitat
A web app which helps locate wildfire prone areas and allows people to report wildfires to authorities. It was built at a 3-hour hackathon and bagged first prize out of 12 teams. Habitat also aimed to use NASAâ€™s Water Vapour (1 month -TERRA/MODIS) data to [identify dry areas prone to wildfires](https://github.com/anaswaratrajan/habitat_dash).
